Welcome! 

In May 2025, I decided to start moving my personal projects onto GitHub. I suppose I am doing this for the same reasons most people do:
1) Actually finish projects that I start
2) Force myself to comprehensible code
3) Showcase the portfolio of things I have been working on for human consumption 

Right now you'll find in here:
1) March Madness Ballot Challenge. The challenge is a pick-em style game for the eponymous tournament that we've played at the office the last few years. It's been a lot of fun to think about and strategize for, and I've worked on a few different approaches to try to "solve" this game.

More projects to come!
