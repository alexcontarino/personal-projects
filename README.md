Welcome! 

In May 2025, I decided to start moving my personal projects onto GitHub, driven by the usual reasons I suppose:
1) Actually finish projects that I start
2) Force myself to write comprehensible code
3) Showcase the portfolio of things I have been working on for human consumption 

Right now you'll find in here:
1) March Madness Ballot Challenge. The challenge is a pick-em style game that we've played at the office the last few years. It's been a lot of fun to think about and strategize for, and I've worked on a few different approaches to try to "solve" this game.
2) Sports Betting. This folder contains a few projects exploring how to best use sportsbook promotions (bonus bets, profit boosts, etc.). 

More projects to come!
